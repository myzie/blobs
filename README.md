# Blobs

Datastore for binary objects with properties. Backed by any S3 compatible
object store along with Postgresql for queries and storing object properties.

## API

Each object has a unique path within its operating context. Context is somewhat
similar to an S3 bucket in this way.

Objects may have an associated JSON `properties` object. The properties objects
are currently schemaless however schemas and validations may be added as
options, somewhat like Firebase. Fast searches on values within the JSON are
easily added via Postgresql's secondary indexes on JSONB.

Using a POST request, clients may upload an object and associated properties in
a single request. The object or the properties may be provided individually as
well.

Behind the scenes, objects are stored in S3 in a fixed bucket with a key
corresponding to the specified object `path`. The `path` field cannot be updated
after the object is created. As a future enhancement, consider a `move` or
`copy` operation to switch to a new path assuming it is not already in use.

When the object is downloaded an alternate name can be set via the HTTP header:
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=FILENAME`.

Potentially the `name` field on the object, stored in Postgres, can be set
automatically upon download. If `name` is blank, the basename from the `path`
will be used.

Authentication is via JWTs and potentially API keys in the future. The JWT may
optionally include the authorized `context`. Although, if a simple authorization
scheme is implemented here that may not be desired.

It is an external choice how to allocate paths and contexts to best suit the
application at hand.

## Fireblob

Everything is objects stored at a path.

GET on /an/item returns the item.

GET on /a/collection/ returns the collection. Trailing slash distinguishes?

Each items may have an attached binary file which will be stored in S3.

Declarative rules for validations and R/W access.

Build users, roles, groups, etc. with the same scheme. They are just other
collections that exist in the system.

Keep core service independent of API specifics like HTTP vs. websocket.

Need to evaluate how fast Postgres querires are to support this? Use LIKE to
find items starting with a prefix. Will that be performant enough?

Perhaps require top-level collections, that way the collection can be indexed
and used in a WHERE clause to quickly cull the results. Or could automatically
split first segment from path to use as the collection. Could be an implicit
empty collection for items at the root level.

Use YAML or JSON or Javascript for declaritive rules? Could probably use a DSL
down the road. Rules could extract items from JWT claims among other things.

Need to define conflict resolution policy. Simple last write wins? Lexical
sorting or some other deterministic algorithm to choose the winner. Let postgres
handle some amount of this?

Need to offer customizable queries?

Continuing to work in an "offline" mode seems popular in open source attempts.
This seems unnecesary.

Clients need to subscribe to collection changes?

Item versioning?

Storage quotas?

Data structures?

 * Database
 * Search engine
 * Cache

Another inspiration: https://deepstreamhub.com/open-source/?io

 * Records (schema-less documents that can be manipulated and observed)
 * Events (publish-subscribe messaging; topic based routing)
 * RPCs (secure, load balancing, fail-over, routing)
 * Database connectors
 * Cache connectors
 * Records can reference each other and be arranged in lists

"Deepstream uses a powerful permission language called Valve that allow for the
creation of granular rulesets, data references and even realtime permission
adjustments."

### Concepts

 * Items: each has a path, JSON properties, optional attachment
 * Validations: ensure items adhere to schema. Could validate attachments too.
 * Permissions: define R/W authorization for individual items or collections.
 * Operations: named mutators that affect the items. Have associated permissions.
 * Principal: the user making requests to the service. Identity from JWT.
 * Limits: restrictions on collection size, total attachment size, etc.
 * Subscriptions: feeds that stream updates to clients. 
 * Filters: reduce items returned when retrieving a collection.
 * Metrics: stats on all the above
